Grails plugin

Similar to localizations and database migrations plugins. 
It enables a developer pattern of the following:

- create branch
- fix one or more bugs  or add a feature
- add appropiate change logs as a bug is fixed or refine a change log as a feature is refined
- when ready, merge in master
- update version number
- commit and merge branch into master
